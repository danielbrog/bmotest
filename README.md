# About
Application to allow users to find a restaurant in their area.  It has two input fields, the first one is for the user to find restaurants in a given city, and the second is to refine the search by either name, address, or area.

# Description of Technologies
The application is built using React as well as Redux for state.

For testing jest was used for snapshot testing and testing with mock state data.  Jest-axe was used for accessibility testing, ensuring best practices were used.

Travis CI was included for tests to be run every push.
